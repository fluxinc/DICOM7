# Project Description

- This is a C# .NET 4.6.2 solution comprising two projects
  - DICOM2ORM - Checks a remote DICOM worklist, generates HL7 ORM messages, and sends them to a receiver
  - DICOM2ORU - Waits for DICOM files that contain images or PDFs, wraps them into ORU messages and delivers them to an HL7 listener
  - ORM2DICOM - Receives incoming HL7 ORM orders, saves them to disk, listens for Worklist C-Find queries, and answers with the ORMs, mapping attributes to DICOM
