# ORU2DICOM Configuration
# Converts HL7 ORU result messages into DICOM studies for downstream PACS systems

# HL7 listener configuration
# Controls how the service accepts inbound ORU messages over MLLP
HL7:
  ListenIP: 0.0.0.0           # Bind address (all interfaces by default)
  ListenPort: 7777            # TCP port for the HL7 listener
  SenderName: DICOM7          # Source application name for ACKs
  ReceiverName: RECEIVER_APPLICATION  # Target application name from incoming ORUs
  ReceiverFacility: RECEIVER_FACILITY # Target facility name from incoming ORUs
  DeferredAckCode: AA         # HL7 ACK code when delivery is deferred for retry

# DICOM send configuration
# Controls how generated DICOM payloads are transmitted
Dicom:
  DestinationHost: localhost  # Destination host for C-STORE messages
  DestinationPort: 104        # Destination port for C-STORE messages
  DestinationAeTitle: PACS    # Called AE Title for the remote destination
  SourceAeTitle: ORU2DICOM    # Calling AE Title announced by this service
  DefaultStudyDescription: "HL7 ORU Result" # Used when ORU lacks study description
  UseTls: false               # Negotiate TLS for C-STORE (requires remote support)

# Cache configuration
# Controls how inbound ORUs and generated DICOM files are retained
Cache:
  Folder: "cache"             # Root cache directory
  RetentionDays: 3            # Days to retain cached artifacts
  KeepSentItems: true         # Preserve sent artifacts under cache\sent\
  AutoCleanup: true           # Enable periodic cache cleanup
  CleanupIntervalMinutes: 60  # Cleanup frequency in minutes
  PersistDicomFiles: true     # Keep generated DICOM files after successful send

# Retry configuration
# Governs how deferred deliveries are retried
Retry:
  RetryIntervalMinutes: 2     # Minutes between retry sweeps
  MaxAttempts: 10             # Max retry attempts before marking error
